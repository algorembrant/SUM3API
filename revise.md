the 'A3' at Tick Data Accuracy Note doesnt properly navigate to the superscript at Accurate tick data transmission with no message loss under normal market conditions.

provide an appendox comment for 'libzmq and losidium are downloadable on the internet', state simillar statements to that and add a reference downlodable links, and also inseft it into somewhere in the document (most relevant part).

Also explain the 'Fig. 1. SUM3API System Framework' in the document (maybe in the methodology part) (see the attached image, its a mermaid diagram output)

Delete this statement " the package operates through an inter
process communication mechanism that introduces latency and
does not support real-time tick streaming with microsecond
level timestamps" and replace it with something not assuming (or you could provide a proof/reference of that claim.
